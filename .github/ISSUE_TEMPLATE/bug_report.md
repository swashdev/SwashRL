**Architecture**
What computer architecture are you using? For example, Windows 32-bit or FreeBSD 64-bit. Keep in mind that if your architecture is not being actively supported by the dev team we may not be able to help you.

**Version**
What version of the program are you running? If you don't know, you can check the global.d source code file or press the v key in-game.

**Description**
Describe the bug in as much detail as you can to give us a good idea of what might have gone wrong. If you received an error message from the program, that would be helpful.

**To Reproduce**
Tell us what you were doing, step-by-step, when the bug occurred in as much detail as you can.  Ideally we should be able to reproduce the problem using the step-by-step description you give us.  If you can, go back into the program and see if you can reproduce the error yourself.  If not, that's fine; we'll still want to hear what you can remember.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
