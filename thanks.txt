SwashRL is dedicated:

  To Seb (1994-2020)  For ten years, he taught me a lot about life, growing
  up, the universe, and people.  He suffered from a number of unfortunate
  health conditions, including mental health problems, but survived and
  persevered in spite of them, teaching me how to be strong myself and take
  care of myself even while trying to help others.  His contributions to my
  life and the value of his companionship can not be overstated.

  Rest in peace, my dear friend and fellow weirdo.  As promised, I will do
  the very best I can to live in a way that you would have been proud of,
  not for pity but for its own sake.  You will be remembered, if only in
  this small way.

Special thanks to the following "Honorary Dev Team Members," who contributed
significant help to the SwashRL source code:

  Elronnd, who has always been willing to provide help with SwashRL in
  general and with the translation into D in particular.

Further thanks to the following people who have contributed code or help in
some way:

  unleashy from GitHub, who explained how to fix PDCurses and allow it to
  compile with dub.

  Björn Bergström, who designed the recursive shadowcasting algorithm for fog
  of war, the Doryen implementation of which is used in SwashRL.

  Bad Diode, who designed the bd-font font which SwashRL uses for the SDL
  terminal interface when it can't find a valid font file.
